Description: Java message broker - server
 Apache ActiveMQ is a message broker built around Java Message Service (JMS)
 API : allow sending messages between two or more clients in a loosely coupled,
 reliable, and asynchronous way.
 .
 This message broker supports :
  * JMS 1.1 and J2EE 1.4 with support for transient, persistent, transactional
    and XA messaging
  * Spring Framework, CXF and Axis integration
  * pluggable transport protocols such as in-VM, TCP, SSL, NIO, UDP, multicast,
    JGroups and JXTA
  * persistence using JDBC along with journaling
  * OpenWire (cross language wire protocol) and
    Stomp (Streaming Text Orientated Messaging Protocol) protocols
 .
 This package contains a server installation of ActiveMQ which is unconfigured.
