opencast for Debian
--------------------------

This package provides a precompiled version of Opencast with all of the 
required libraries, and dependencies on the external programs (notably FFmpeg
and ActiveMQ).  This package provides all of the files required for Opencast
to start and run, but does *not* set any of the required configuration value
for a production system.
